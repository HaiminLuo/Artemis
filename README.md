## [Project page](https://haiminluo.github.io/publication/artemis/) |  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05628)
This repository contains a pytorch implementation for the paper: [Artemis: Articulated Neural Pets with Appearance and Motion Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05628). In this paper, we present **ARTEMIS**, a novel neural modeling and rendering pipeline for generating **ART**iculated neural pets with app**E**arance and **M**otion synthes**IS**.<br><br>
